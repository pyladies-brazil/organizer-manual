In this manual we are going to explain to you how Django Girls works, what you need to do and how to get started. So... let's get into details:

## What is Django Girls?

Django Girls is an initiative that is aimed at introducing women who have never coded before to the world of technology and increasing the diversity within the industry.

We do that by organizing workshops and inviting women to join us to learn how to build the internet using HTML, CSS, Python and Django in a safe, friendly, inclusive environment.

Our mission is to bring more women into the tech field by making technology more approachable, simpler and friendlier. We provide tools, resources and a community that makes it easier to learn about technology.
