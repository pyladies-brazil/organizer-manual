# Conference partnerships

One of the ways to boost your event is by partnering with conferences in your city (or neighboring cities!). This section contains some (hopefully) helpful tips and guidelines that you can use when you communicate and operate with a conference.

When you first approach a conference, assuming that they're interested, you can bring up any of the standard sponsorship requests as you would with any sponsor. However, there are a few unique areas where conferences can be a great source of support, more so than other types of sponsors.


## Conference tickets

Some conferences can be very expensive, others are free. If you can arrange for free entrance to the conference for participants, great! Discount? Still good! Just crunch the numbers and see if you can make up the difference with sponsorship funds.

## Space for the workshop

If the conference is longer than 2-3 days (for example, EuroPython is 5 days + 2 sprint days), you might be able to get access to a room during the first day of the conference. Otherwise, the conference might be able to help you reserve space at/near the venue on the day before the conference begins. 

This will help orientate the participants to the venue, and if you time the breaks with the conference schedule, the participants will be able to mingle with conference attendees from the start! 

## Financial aid 

More and more conferences are kicking off diversity activities, scholarships, talk mentoring programs, and more. If you aim for international attendance, you could approach the conference for help with travel funds and accommodation. 

For example, many conferences already have room blocks or discounts at hotels, and might also be able to directly sponsor the rooms (or arrange for an invoice that another sponsor can pay directly to the hotel).

## Swag and food

If you are partnering with a conference that already has a few hundred attendees, they should be able to arrange for a few dozen shirts, bags, nametags, lunch spots, etc. You can also ask to be connected with the conference sponsors for further support.

Note: coach shirts are better arranged separately, because then you can have control over the design, but shirts or nametags for participants that bear the conference logo are a great way to help the participants feel like they are a part of the bigger event, and it's not out of your workshop budget.

## Cross-promotion and online traction

Conferences normally have a large-to-huge mailing list, countless followers on Twitter, and a [social media strategist](http://elitedaily.com/envision/these-20-photos-prove-that-you-take-your-job-title-way-too-seriously-photos/651099/). You can therefore leverage their online presence to call out for coaches, sponsors, or even participants (as in "tell your women friends about us so they can come to the conference too!").

## Lightning talks 

If you can secure a Django Girls lightning talk, they're a great way to introduce conference attendees to the project and broadcast a call to action. Check out the resources repository on GitHub for presentation templates!

## Sprint/hackfest

A sprint/hackfest is a great way to give participants the space to continue to work on their websites, extend it, edit the tutorial, or simply learn more Django or Python! 

If the conference is Python/Django-focused, you can probably join an existing sprint room where core developers are already working. Otherwise, you can announce the sprint/hackfest as a general Django/Python event and invite core developers or other interested parties who want to learn or work on Python/Django. 

## Table/booth

Attending your first tech conference can be scary, even when you're not an absolute beginner! A well-placed booth will give the workshop participants a "home base", where they can return to if they feel lost. Having a booth also gives a chance for the participants (new graduates!) to act as subject matter experts, as conference attendees tend to walk up, look around and ask questions. 

Some tips and suggestions for a successful booth:

* The booth should be operated by at least 1 coach/organizer and 1-2 participants, so that attendees can learn about the different perspectives of the project. The easiest way to set this up is to create a Doodle with timeslots for each "shift", and ask participants to "vote" for the times that they can attend.
* When you order swag for the workshop, choose a few key items and order double/triple/etc. so that you have enough to give away at the conference. For example, at DevConf.cz we ordered twice the amount of pens and buttons as we gave out during the workshop, and they were gone by the end of the first day!
* Decorations for the booth are up to you! Some options could be printed tablecloths, rollups, LED lightstrips, and so on. Cupcakes are recommended too ;-)
* Make sure you have at least 1-2 power adapters/extension cords, as conferences do not always provide these! Optional: Arrange for a computer monitor where you can run a slideshow of previous Django Girls workshop photos, demo the tutorial in action, etc.
