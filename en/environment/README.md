# Environment

The goal of Django Girls is not only to teach people about programming, but to __do it in a friendly and positive environment.__

Django Girls events are inclusive, friendly and safe environments. Girls, women, ladies, gals and even men are allowed in. More than semantics weâ€™re interested in a mindset.

## Positive atmosphere

Django Girls events are welcoming for everyone. We want to spend a great day surrounded by fantastic people and have lots of fun together. We're not very serious people.

Do selfies or Friday Hugs. Let people know that they're doing a great job and are awesome. Make friends.

## Code of Conduct

Each event has to follow and enforce our [Code of Conduct](http://djangogirls.org/coc/). The CoC is a set of rules that aim to provide inclusive environment for people of different genders, colors, religion or else.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, should not be tolerated.

You, as an organizer, have the right to take any action you deem appropriate, including a warning, temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community.
