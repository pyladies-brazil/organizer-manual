# Logistics

There are a couple of things that are important while organizing a Django Girls event. We won't try to explain everything in the smallest detail, but we do elaborate on a couple of most important things:

## Venue

General rule about the venue: very often, you can get a space for free. Your targets are: big coworking spaces, hackerspaces, makerspaces, univerisities, local companies, startups. These are the places that may be willing to offer you space for free (especially during weekends).

The setup should allow you to sit comfortably everyone in small groups (team of 3 + 1 coach). The best setup is just square tables (or two tables put together) with 4 chairs around it.

### Power cords

Remember that they all need power :) Often the venue can offer you this, but if they can't, just ask attendees and coaches to bring one power cord each -- this way you will have more than enough.

### Internet

Internet is crucial, so ask your venue provider if they have tested the WiFi before. Be prepared for some problems, so have all the material (tutorial, bootstrap, csses) downloaded and saved on a couple of pendrives.

It is possible that the venue will claim they can handle Internet traffic, but during the workshop it turns out it is not working. It's a good idea to ask if they have previously hosted programming workshops for 100+ people. 

It's a good idea to have some backup mobile internet and to create a hotspot for attendees if internet is not working properly. Make sure to check - especially during the installation part - if there are no problems with the Internet.

### Decorations

Good atmosphere and friendly experience is extremely important, so if your budget is big enough, don't think twice about [printing some posters](../resources/README.html), buying fresh flowers or bringing nice table clothes. These small little things can go a long way and bring a better experience for everyone. We like nice things, right?

## Food

If you don't have enough budget, don't worry too much. It's a free event, people will be grateful to you anyway. Lunch is the most important one, because you want to keep people energized and don't want to provide too much distraction.

But if you can, it's awesome to do this:

### Breakfast

Usually buying some pastries or donuts on the way to the venue is enough. Order coffee/tea from a catering company or buy some in the store.

### Lunch

Order something fresh and tasty. Plan for ~25% of vegetarian option (some people just prefer veggies even if they are not vegetarians). If you don't have a lot of money buying bread and different toppings like sausage and cheese, peanut butter etc. at a store so people can make themselves sandwiches are a good option.

### Drinks

Buy some water, juices and lemons with paper/plastic cups before the event so you don't have to overpay the catering company for this stuff. Usually 1 liter per person per day is sufficient. If you don't have a car transporting that much water might be a problem. You can ask some of you coaches or other helpers to meet you at a store the morning of the workshop and help you carry the water to the venue. In case you run out of water or food it's good to have a helper available who can go to the store for you during the workshop.

### Snacks

Have some fresh fruit or healthy snacks (energy bars!) laying around the venue. You can also buy it in the store before the event. We recommend fruit that you don't have to cut - apples, grapes, bananas :)

## Goodies

This is only if you have enough money for it.

### Temporary tattoos!

This is so far the most fun and most affordable way to do something nice at your event. You only need to buy [Temporary Tattoo Paper](http://www.amazon.com/Silhouette-MEDIA-TATTOO-Temporary-Tattoo-Paper/dp/B0043WJ3OA/), print [our ready-to-go designs](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/resources/tree/master/Design/Tattoos) on your home printer, cut them out and you're good to go! You can get a lot of tattoos for just a couple of bucks.

### T-shirts for coaches

Order t-shirts for your coaches as a thank-you gift, but it also makes them more visible in the venue. You can find t-shirt designs on our [resources page](../resources/README.html).

### Tote bags

We like tote bags, right?! They are also pretty cheap to print and it's a nice gift for your attendees that will remind them about the event later on :)

### Stickers

Pssst, [Stickermule](http://stickermule.com/) likes to sponsor events with free stickers! You can find our [ready-to-print designs here](../resources/README.html).

## Marketing

### Photos & Videos

This is reaaally nice to have and sometimes you can get this kind of stuff for free if you have friends / friendly local people who want to support your initiative. It's a great memory to do some nice, professional photo reports from the event or record a video. It also helps to use it as marketing material for your next event and you have something to show to the sponsors.

If you have resources (money / people), then totally do it. It's worth it :)

You can also let us know and add your event's photos to our [Django Girls albums](https://www.flickr.com/photos/128162583@N08/sets). Make sure to provide us information about __a licence of the photo__ - if anyone can use them? For example other Django Girls organizers? If the photos/video can be used - on what terms?
