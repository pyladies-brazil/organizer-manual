# Attendees

The main idea of Django Girls is to bring new people into technology. __We are focusing on females, but it is totally fine to organize workshops without any gender requirement__. We encourage local organizers to give a priority to female applications, especially when the workshop is organized under the Django Girls name. 

The tutorial is designed for total beginners, so no programming background is needed. Basically, any person with a computer can do it.

However there are problems. If you organize something for free there is a chance that some people will not appear at all. They didn't invest any time or money, so it is easy for them to simply not come. That's why you should try to find people who really, really care.

The only way you could measure somebody's commitment is their application form. Make sure that it contains questions that will give you necessary hints about the person.

## How do people sign up?

### Local events

If you don't plan on providing any Financial Aid for participants you should open an application process at least a month (ideally two) before the event. Give people two weeks to apply and explain why they should be the ones to attend the event, what is their motivation. You can create a simple Google Doc Form or use a free service like Wufoo. Send people acceptance/rejection e-mails a week before the event. Make sure they confirm that they will attend.

### International events

If you organize an event and expect having people from many different countries you should start much earlier. There is a chance that you will have people who need visas. In this case you need to let people know if they are invited at least one month before the event.

#### Visa invitation letter

It is also possible that you will need to provide an invitation letter for the participants who require visas. It could look like this:

> Through this paper we certify  that _[name of participant]_, born _[birth date of participant]_, living at _[country]_, _[address]_, with passport number _[passport number of participant]_, valid from _[date]_ to _[date]_ is invited during the period of [date] to [date] to participate in the Django Girls workshop organised by _[name of some legal entity or you]_ with the address: _[address]_; phone: _[phone]_, e-mail: _[email]_.

> _[here you can put some info about who organises the event - if it a part of conference you should put some info about it here]_

> Free food and social activities will be provided by organisers during the period of stay.

> We kindly request to grant a free visa for this particular participant of the Django Girls workshop.

> [your name]

You will need to send this letter (signed!) to the participant. You should also scan the signed papers and send the copy via e-mail.

## Application form

### Google Doc Form

As we have mentioned you can use Google Doc Forms for this purpose. You can do that by going to your Google Drive, clicking the "CREATE" button and choosing "Form" and the "Create and share" option. Then you should fill in all the necessary data: name, layout, etc..

You can also copy our existing template form by [clicking this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_C3Jp-QULdUBB9e8c_n2MG0s0ckkwABoIJvZGG5mbi4/edit?usp=sharing) and then choosing "File" and "Make a copy..." option in the menu.

### Questions

What kind of questions should you ask in the form? We have a list of those we used or those we think could be useful for future events.

1. What is your name?
2. Your e-mail address?
3. Your phone number. Include your country prefix
4. Where are you from? City, country
5. How old are you?
6. Your laptop: What operating system do you have? (Windows | Mac OS X | Linux | Other)
7. What is your current occupation? Tell us what you currently do: working, learning or something else?
8. What is your background? Do you have experience with making websites?
9. Why do you want to attend Django Girls?
10. What are you planning to do to share what you have learned with others?
11. How did you heard about Django Girls? (Facebook | Twitter | From a friend | Other)
12. What language are you more comfortable with? (English | (language of your country) | Both)

#### Financial aid questions

1. Do you need financial assistance to come and stay in [city]?
2. What is your current financial situation? Tell us why you need financial assistance.
3. How much money do you need? Give us an exact amount of Euro you need. Try to break down costs.

Some questions are not required. For example question 5 (age) is only used for statistical purposes.

It is also a good idea to ask about previous experience in fields like: programming (any language), Python, CSS, HTML, Django, databases etc.. Thanks to that you will be able to team up people based on how advanced they are. Also ask your attendees what language they are comfortable with. Some of your coaches might only speak English so they will need to coach a group who is comfortable being taught in English, and even if there isn't a translation of your tutorial in your country's language available yet you can at least make sure that the attendees feel comfortable by having a coach who speaks their language.

#### Form submit notifications

By default Google Forms won't send any e-mail about the form being submitted. You won't be notified and the person filling out the form won't know what information she has submitted. This is of course not required but people like to have some form of confirmation that the data was saved.

There are many ways of solving this issue. The easiest way of setting up notifications can be achieved by installing a simple plugin from Google. It is [available in the Add-on store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/form-notifications/bbpdeojefjfhaelgljjcadpcckdfcdod). The disatvantage of this solution is that the e-mails will be sent from your private gmail inbox - not the your_city@djangogirls.org one. If you know some JavaScript basics you can also play with Script Manager for a more customisable notification system. Follow the detailed instructions found [here](http://davidwees.com/content/email-confirmations-google-forms/) and use [our version of the script](https://gist.github.com/aniav/926f4667911ba1d138b8) instead of the code shown there. We have already used this way in several events - it's safe.

## How to choose attendees?

If you receive a lot of applications you will face a very hard problem: who should you choose? It was very hard for us to decide, but we came up with a way to score applications.

We had four people scoring applications. We used Andrew Godwin's Django app created especially for this purpose. You can find it here: https://github.com/andrewgodwin/grorg. It is a good idea to ask Andrew directly about the app, especially if you have some funding from the Django Software Foundation.

You can also add additional columns for the people scoring the applications where they would put their scores (it's nice to colour them!). You should also hide the columns with personal information so that the scores won't be influenced by these details. After the scoring process is done you should sum up all the votes in an additional column (e.g. called TOTAL) and sort the whole document by the column with the total score (Data > Sort sheet by column X Z â†’ A). You will then have a spreadsheet with the people that will be able to attend the event as the first ones.

### Scoring

To ensure that the first score is not influenced by others, each person scored applications without knowing the other three people's scores. After making a first scoring, one could see the other marks.

The order of applications was also not determined - we scored in random order, so the probability that one person is scored higher/lower only because she was always on top/bottom of the list, was low.

We scored each application from 1 to 5.

Here is a list of things we took into account when scoring (suggested by Daniele Procida):

* what is the realistic benefit to the applicant?

* what is the realistic benefit to others?

* does the applicant have clear, specific, concrete, realistic ideas about what to do with the knowledge?

* does the applicant have clear, specific, concrete, realistic ideas about how she will share it?

* do I feel the applicant really, really wants this opportunity, or is it just an interesting offer to her?

* what is the overall value-for-money, if the applicant is asking for funds?

* what is my overall feeling about the application?

As you can see, there were a lot of points we took into account when scoring. It was very, very hard to get in. If the application was not very detailed - the chance to be accepted was very low. But writing a lot was not a recipe for success. We looked for concrete ideas and commitments in applications.

Look for a diverse group: the more different people are, the more crazy / fun / creative ideas will happen during the event.

The final tip: follow you heart :) Choose those who convince you the most, those who need it, those who may want to change their lives and follow this path as a career. The choice is yours, but it's never easy.

## Acceptance/rejection e-mails

Make sure you write to all people who have applied - not only to those who get in. It is as easy as sending the same thing to all e-mail addresses. Just make sure to put the addresses as BCC, so they are hidden to other people who receive the e-mail.

It's a good idea to create a waiting list. We informed them that they didn't get in, but they were very close and asked them if they will be interested to join at a short notice if a spot will be available.

## People resigning

We had a number of people who said they won't manage to come even though they confirmed their attendence before. The waiting list worked very well in this scenario.

Be prepared to have some last minute (one day before the workshops) cancellations. It's normal. As long as you have people who can fill in it's fine.
